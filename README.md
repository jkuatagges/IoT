#### Abstract
<hr>

- This repo is a backup to my journey in interest working with [Embeded Systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/embedded_systems/es_overview.htm), i.e a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system. A vaariety of devkit boards have been explored in this publication, depending on the interest of he reader, you can choose from one that intersts you.

##### Requirents, Dependencies and Tools used
<hr>

The following are some basic requirements to achieve the aims of this project
1.  Devkit Prototyping Boards: Either of theses boards *At least one* of them will get you started.
    - `Africastalking ERIS Devkit Board`
    - `Raspberry PI`
    - `Arduino`, `STM32`, `Any ARM enabled Board`.

2. `Breadboard`,`LEDs`, `Sensors`, `Power source ~ 5V-12V DC to power the boards (Please check your board rating first before hooking them up), 
3. Intergrated Developement Environment for uploading code into any board. Each board might have a unique IDE.
4. For the `pi`, Virtual Network Computer(VNC)(Optional) to view your pi remotely or any other viewer.
5. IoT gateway e.g a PC, or Mac that will control your IoT devices.
6. Basic Computer Programming skills.

#### Errata.
<hr>

Although I have taken every care to ensure the accuracy my our content here in,I'm human and mistakes
do happen. If you find a mistake in this project—maybe a mistake in the text or
the code—I would be grateful if you could report this to me via [mail](jaylabs2030@gmail.com) or via visiting my official [website](https://okomojacob.herokuapp.com). By doing so, you can
save others from frustration and help me improve subsequent versions of this mini-project and related works.

One of the greatest benefits of Working with `Embedded Systems`, especially the [Raspberry PI](https://www.google.com/search?q=raspberry+pi&sxsrf=ALeKk01grBSMcQU0GLnDL_4y8phqHjjcPg:1614927201337&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=TJ4wJpZVMQHa7M%252CDtHoUD5AlbtMeM%252C%252Fm%252F0gmg36g&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kQfF9ip8UyewJOzkBCddE2hBXxR0Q&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYyLHRyJjvAhXGXRUIHX1HBcgQ_B16BAg7EAE#imgrc=TJ4wJpZVMQHa7M) is its great kind and helpful user community here at [Raspberry Website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
For help with any aspect of related to handling it - from installation, to application design, to
to deployment - feel free to ask questions online.
